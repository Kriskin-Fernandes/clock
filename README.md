DISCLAIMER: chatGPT did most of the coding, but i made both fonts. 
the fonts need to be in the same folder as the html file for it to work

basic clock that shows the day, date and time
has some additional functionality
the clock displays in the format DAY, dd mm yy, hh mm ss

there is a text box below the time, here is where you can execute commands
typing a "#" followed by a hex color code changes the background to that color
typing a "!" changes all text after it to morse code, where each letter is read top-to-bottom
typing a "?" scrambles the date, day and time and generates a random 7 digit number
typing $123$ starts a countdown for 123 seconds, can be used with any number
typing musical notes (A-G) and then % at the end plays the notes. you can combine notes inside brackets eg(ABC) to play them all at once
typing a frequency in Hz and then % plays the frequency until the % is deleted
typing a "/" opens the download directory on my laptop, but the path will be different for yours, so just avoid it or fix it.
typing text and ending it with a "&" reverses the text in the input field
the page doesnt have a calculator function because my browser already has one built in
